I recently spoke at a meetup in Austin about Apple's [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) framework and what it means for the networking landscape in Swift.

I took some inspiration from [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Marin Todorov](https://twitter.com/icanzilb) to level up my live demo game, and I hope it paid off. I would also like to thank an unnamed person for making the playground part of this possible - this person knows who this person is, but I can't say their name publicly :-D

Anyway, if you want to see how you can make a TCP server in an Xcode playground, here's something relevant to your interests. Enjoy!!

This talk was based on a tutorial I wrote for [raywenderlich.com](raywenderlich.com), which you can read [here](http://okun.io/2018/04/09/tcp-server-with-swift-nio/).
