> This is a video cast of a live workshop I ran for [Kodeco (formerly raywenderlich.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YdsmS7AEDo). The text below is the description of the workshop.

Ever wondered about creating your own iOS app but felt overwhelmed by where to start? How long do you think it takes to code a functional app? What if we told you that you could develop a todo app for your iPhone in an hour with less than 50 lines of code? If this piques your interest, we've got just the thing for you.

Join David Okun, Principal Engineer at LTK, for "Build a Real iOS App From Scratch: A Workshop for Beginners from Kodeco." This workshop is all about breaking down the barriers to iOS app development and making it accessible, fun, and rewarding for beginners.

In this free workshop, we'll guide you step-by-step through the exciting process of building your very own iOS app. You'll get hands-on experience with Swift and SwiftUI, learning about basic data structures and how to manage app states effectively.

By the end of our session, you'll gain valuable skills and insights into how iOS apps behave, including how to implement list editing features. More importantly, you'll have a functional app that you've coded yourself.

Whether you're aiming to try out the world of app development or looking for a productive way to kickstart your learning before tackling more in-depth material, this workshop is designed to provide a supportive, engaging environment for your first steps. Let's start building something great together.

Prerequisites: To code along, please take the following steps:

1. Install Xcode (see "Installing Xcode" here: https://bit.ly/3wnLMlv )
2. Open a new project (Select an iOS app from File - New - Project)
3. Make sure you can run your project by pressing âŒ˜ + R

If you see "Hello, World!" you're good to go!
