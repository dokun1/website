> This is mirrored from [Kodeco (formerly raywenderlich.com)](https://www.raywenderlich.com/196340/new-course-server-side-swift-with-kitura), a post that announces a new video course I wrote at the time.

If you're ready to level up your skills to become a full stack developer, we're releasing a brand new course for you today: <a href="https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/123-server-side-swift-with-kitura/lessons/1">Server Side Swift with Kitura</a>!

Kitura is a REST API framework written in Swift by IBM. If you ever wanted to extend your skills past developing for mobile devices, but didn't have time to learn a new language, this is your chance!

In this 31-video course, you'll learn how to write a server in Swift, link a mobile app with it, and how to make a website in Swift using your server.

Take a look at what's inside:
