author: David Okun
abstract: Swift has made incredible progress in the server-side domain since 2015, but let's face it - server maintenance isn't always fun. Thanks to OpenWhisk and IBM Cloud Functions, you don't have to worry about it. In this session, we'll take a glimpse at how quickly a Swift developer can get a managed web service up and running, and how to use it in any application.
