title: "Expanding To The Server With Swift & Kitura"
abstract: The open-sourcing of Swift has given the mobile developer community the ability to take the language anywhere. Learning about the existence of Kitura had a profound effect on me, personally - it made me a full-stack developer by way of knowing the language I already know. In this talk, I'll show you how Kitura can empower you to take what you already know about Swift, and expand it to an entirely new domain.
