title: "Training Core ML With Your Mobile Camera During A Conference Talk"
date: 2018-06-19T00:00:00Z
abstract: This will be a collaborative experience - come help David pick some objects to train a CoreML model on stage! We’ll use an iPhone camera to take some photos, then we’ll use IBM Watson to train the model. After that, with (literally) one line of code, we’ll deploy the model into an iOS framework called Lumina to test the model on stage with all of the different objects!
