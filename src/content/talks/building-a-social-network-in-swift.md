abstract: “But is it really ready for production?” Server-side Swift has come a long way in just a few years. Ian Partridge and David Okun will show how full-stack Swift is ready for your next project, along with the open standards you can take advantage of as you go live on the cloud. Spend more time writing Swift and less time talking about it!
