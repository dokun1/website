title: Kitura - Beyond Hello World!
abstract: Created by IBM, Kitura is a high performance and simple to use web framework for building modern Swift applications. You can run it in any environment that supports Swift - your development Mac, your Mac server (if you have one), or Linux-based VMs and containers that you can easily set up for just a few dollars a month. Simplify your application development by writing your front and back-ends in the same language, and do it with an open-source language and components. Everything that you need to run Kitura is on GitHub (https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura).
