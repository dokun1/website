title: From C++ To Swift - Modern Cross Platform SDKs
abstract: In this presentation, I talk about how a team of image processing developers write a C++ framework that needs to be used in iOS. This covers the actual work done and how the interface needs to be written in Objective-C to create a good Swift interface for all iOS developers to be able to use.
