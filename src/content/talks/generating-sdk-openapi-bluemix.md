abstract: If you're reading this, you're reading the one abstract I forgot to hang onto. What's worse? This was my own freaking conference that I ran, and I don't have any record of what I spoke about. Slides are below, and I show you how to generate a Swagger file which is neat, but ya, pretty bad move IMHO.
