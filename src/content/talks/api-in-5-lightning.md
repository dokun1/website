title: "(Lightning Talk) API In 5 - Loopback"
abstract: Web APIs are hard. Now, thanks to Loopback, they don't have to be. In this talk, I'll show you (yes! you!) how you can have a RESTful web service up in minutes to support any application you want to make - mobile, Angular, anything - and how you can build on it to make it do whatever you need it to.
