title: "Getting Started With Server Side Swift and Kitura"
date: 2018-04-06T00:00:00Z
author: David Okun
abstract: Kitura is the REST API framework in Swift written by IBM, and has been in development since Swift was open sourced. In this workshop, I'll get you started with a fully functional API using the latest and greatest features of Swift. You'll have an API that uses Codable for GET, POST, and DELETE requests - simplifying the code you have to write. Finally, I'll introduce you to Kitura's new ORM feature, which builds on top of Codable to make saving data even easier than before!
