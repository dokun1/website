## Professional
I am a Principal Engineer who currently works for LTK, remotely in Austin, Texas. I was originally born in Houston, but I've been fortunate to live in tons of places.

I feel most at home working in Apple's developer ecosystems. Please check out my CV if you'd like to see all of my experience.

## Personal

### Family

I am happily married and we have one baby boy. He takes up most of my time right now but he's the best baby in the world. No argument.

### Cooking

I really enjoy cooking at home, for friends and for family. One time I got to be in a video with Joshua Weissman, and it was super fun:

<div style="max-width: 560px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
    <iframe 
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJG38AL2rMc" 
      frameborder="0" 
      allowfullscreen 
      style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

### Travel

I've been very fortunate to see a lot of the world in my personal and professional life. At the end of 2016, I moved back to the USA from London, UK, where I lived for several years. Some other places that I've also been lucky enough to visit are: 

- Florence
- Singapore
- Dubrovnik
- Paris
- Bogota
- Istanbul
- Hyderabad
- Kaunas
- Johannesburg
- Sa√µ Paulo
- Tokyo
- Brisbane

I try to take good photos on my Instagram [here](https://instagram.com/dokun1) whenever I go somewhere, so feel free to take a look. Lately, it's just been photos of my son, wife, and dog.

### Music 

I used to play a lot of music. I started with guitar, but can also play bass. I feel most comfortable on the drums, or singing Karaoke. I was even a DJ at a nightclub in Houston back in 2012.

Fun fact: The first instrument I ever learned how to play was the chanter, which is integral to the bagpipes.

I do have a Soundcloud that I haven't posted to in over 12 years. I won't tell you the link. I should probably pick up an instrument, it's been a while.
